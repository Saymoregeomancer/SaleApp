# saleApp


This is a SPA for tracking discounts on a specific product (for now, it works only with zakaz.atbmarket.com/ other stores in the future).
After registration (using a simple JWT - token), you copy the link to the product in the official store and paste it on the add product page and confirm. After that, it will be on the main page with other products, then you can see if there is a discount on your products and whether it is worth going to the store.
